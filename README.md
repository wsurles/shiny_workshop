# Shiny Workshop

## What is Shiny?
Shiny is a new package from RStudio that makes it incredibly easy to build interactive web applications with R

For an introduction or to see some live examples , visit the [Shiny homepage](http://www.rstudio.com/shiny) 

## Why do I like it?

#### Some cool features: 
* No javaScript required. Shiny handles all that stuff. It may be the fastest way to build a useful web application to share data analysis in R 
* Its live. Outputs change instantly as users modify inputs, without requiring a reload of the browser. So different users can see different segments of the data, or time ranges, or whatever they want. Theres no need to to make 20 charts if you have 20 segments.
* You can easily add in interactive charts like rCharts, GoogleVis or D3. You can also customize the look and feel of the page because it is, after all, a web page. We won't be doing that here, but the ability to customize the look and feel of the page is endless. 


## Whats in this workshop?

* We will build 2 shiny apps. 
* The first app is a basic app to show how it works. 
* The second uses data from the [Github timeline on Google Big Query](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/publicdata:samples.github_timeline?pli=1). We will rank the most popular languages this year on github.
* There is a **master** branch which you should work from. All the instructions are in the readme for each app directory.
* If you get stuck take a look in the **answers** branch for help
* If you finish quickly, checkout the **advanced** branch to add a few more cool features to your apps. 
* Don't copy and paste my code. Type all the code yourself and you will get a sense for what you are coding. 

## Lets get started
