# Shiny Workshop

## What is Shiny?
Shiny is a new package from RStudio that makes it incredibly easy to build interactive web applications with R.

For an introduction or to see some live examples, visit the [Shiny homepage](http://www.rstudio.com/shiny).

## Why do I like it?

#### Some cool features: 
* No JavaScript required. Shiny handles all that stuff. It may be the fastest way to build a useful web application to share data analysis in R.
* It's live. Outputs change instantly as users modify inputs, without requiring a reload of the browser. 
* Different users can see different segments of the data, or time ranges, or whatever they want. There's no need to make 20 charts if you have 20 segments.
* You can easily add in interactive charts like rCharts, GoogleVis or D3. You can also customize the look and feel of the page because it is, after all, a web page. We won't be doing that here, but the ability to customize the look and feel of the page is endless. 


## Whats in this workshop?

* We will build 2 shiny apps. 
* The first app is a basic app to show how it works. 
* The second uses data from the [GitHub timeline on Google BigQuery](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/publicdata:samples.github_timeline?pli=1). We will rank the most popular languages this year on GitHub.
* There is a **master** branch which you should work from. All the instructions are in the readme for each app directory.
* If you get stuck take a look in the **answers** branch for help
* If you finish quickly, checkout the **advanced** branch to add a few more cool features to your apps. 
* Don't copy and paste my code. Type all the code yourself and you will get a sense for what you are coding. 

## Let's get started
Click on the **app_getting_started** directory and follow the instructions in the README to get started.
