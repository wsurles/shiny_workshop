# Getting Started - App 0

You only need to write **two** files to make this work.

**server.R** says what to do with the data

**ui.R** say how to show the data

Pretty simple eh?

## First, lets set up R and Shiny

#### Get R
http://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/

If you are not here at the workshop in Colorado you can choose the closest CRAN mirror to you here
http://www.r-project.org/

#### Get R Studio desktop
http://www.RStudio.com/ide/download/desktop

#### Launch R studio

#### Install packages we will be using. 

Shiny is a package for R. We will use other packages also. These and other packages are what make R so great for data analysis. Props go to [the RStudio team](http://www.rstudio.com/about/) and [Hadley Wickham](https://github.com/hadley) for making all of this possible. 

Just type this into the RStudio terminal
```s
install.packages("shiny")
install.packages("plyr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("reshape2")
install.packages("lubridate")
```
If you aleady have the package you will see a message about 'updating loaded packages'. Click 'Cancel'.

Go ahead and load the packages by typing this into the RStudio terminal
```s
library(shiny)
library(plyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
library(lubridate)
```

## Now lets make a shiny app!

We will create a **server.R** and **ui.R** file and save these files to the directory **app_getting_started**

You can create a new R script in the top left of RStudio.

![logo](www/new_rscript.png?raw=true  =100x20)

Put this code in the **server.R** file
```s
shinyServer(function(input,output) {})
```

Put this code in the **ui.R** file. We make a spot for a title, inputs, and outputs.
```s
shinyUI(pageWithSidebar(
  headerPanel("Just Getting Started"),
  sidebarPanel(
    h4("Selection input will go here")
    ),
  mainPanel(
    h4("Charts and tables will go here")
    )
  ))
```
#### Set working directory
Cool. Now set your working directory to the location of the file by choosing Session -> Set Working Directory -> To Source File Location.

And then back up one level by typing `setwd('../')` in the RStudio terminal so you are in the **shiny_workshop** directory. Type `getwd()` to see your working directory.

## Run your shiny App
Type `runApp("app_getting_started")` in the RStudio terminal.

Your default browser should open with an instance of your shiny app. It will look like this.

**You are finished! Great Job!** You created the framework for a shiny app. You are all set up with the software and are ready to make your first Shiny App. Help someone else near you that is not finished. We will start building our first app, **app_historgam** together soon.
